## Library Candidate raylib
[Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) is a simple but popular game programming library written in C.
It provides support for mean things like window management, input, rendering, shaders, audio, etc...

## Progress Report
Right away, raylib was the first library considered as candidate.
Game developers are likely to have used it before, it's well documented, is actively being worked on by a dedicated man.
It sounds great.

It's pretty fitting altogether but as of today, 08-05-25, its features are just a little too limited for Prisma's requirements.
This was slightly expected since raylib is made for creating games, not for creating game engines.
However we will try to see how to get it working as well as possible.
