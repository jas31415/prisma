## About
Prisma is a video game engine waiting to be born.
This project was started around the 28th of March 2025, and is hoping to one day be able to produce games.

>[!NOTE]
> Prisma is just getting started.
> If you have any feedback or suggestions to give, feel free to [submit an issue](https://github.com/jas31415/prisma/issues/new) about it.

## Plans
Since this entire project is still a ball of uncertainty, this file will be used to list plans related to the engine.
The aim right now is toward making a simple application that can produce a simple game.
It is not looking for success, but instead is looking for a learning experience.

- [ ] **Goal:** Establish a game, which its mechanics should be reproducible with the engine's components.
- [ ] **System:** Design the systems with which these components will be interacting with one another.
- [ ] **Interface:** Create an elegant user interface with which Prisma's components can be used by a developer.

Wherever this goes, Prisma should be loud and proud about its connections to queer spaces.

## For Developers
Here are the instructions for building and compiling this project.
Prisma uses the **g++ compiler** along with **Make**.
If you are using VSCode, using the Makefile Tools plugin, or whatever tool you fancy for it.
Use default configuration, "main" as build target, and "main" as launch target.
